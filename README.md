# smart-contract-maven-archetypes

maven acrchetypes for smart contract development in java with eclipse and a model driven approach

Creates an eclipse project with an [UML2Solidity](https://github.com/UrsZeidler/uml2solidity) ready model and a generation config to produce a simple java application to deploy and manage smart contracts. The application uses the [eth-contract-api]https://github.com/adridadou/eth-contract-api to access the ethereum blockchain, native via [ethereumj](https://github.com/UrsZeidler/ethereumj) or per rpc via [web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j).

Generate and write [Junit](https://github.com/UrsZeidler/uml2solidity/wiki/TestWithJava) tests for the smart contracts and execute them on the standalone blockchain really fast.

Change the used implementation simple and fast via system properties.
